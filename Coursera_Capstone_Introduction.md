# Coursera_Capstone Report

## Part 1 Introduction:

#### 1.1 Background:
San Francisco is a huge city with a diverse and large population. It is home to many and provides numerous jobs and opportunities. Throughout San Francisco, there are many areas with high crime rates. These high crime rates can influence where people shop to where people live. Each year the crime rates in different areas change, resulting in a different environment. Looking at the rate and type of crime in a multitude of areas is really important in order to ensure your well-being. This information, derived from crime reports by the San Francisco Police Department, can tell you where are the safest places to travel or safest routes in the city. 

#### 1.2 Problem:
There are two main problems that the data will solve. First, it will find which areas have the highest crime rate in a certain year and plot that on an interactive map. The data will also find the nearest venue to the crime scene. Secondly, the data will also be used to find the top 3 types of crimes in each district and compare and group each district to each other based on the type of crime and frequency. Tourists and the police would be interested in the results of this project for many reasons. Firstly, Tourists can figure out where are the safest places to travel and the safest routes in San Francisco. Secondly, the police can figure out where to send their patrolling officers based on the type of crime and frequency of crime. Therefore, this project can contribute much-needed information to the general public.
